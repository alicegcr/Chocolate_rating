# Chocolate_rating
The main proposal of this project is to understand which aspects make a chocolate a favorite.

## Overview 

## Questions 

- What are the top-rated chocolate bars in your database, and what makes them so popular among consumers?
- Are there any trends or patterns in the types of chocolate bars that receive high ratings? For example, do dark chocolate bars tend to be rated higher than milk chocolate bars?
- Are there any seasonal or regional trends in chocolate bar ratings? For example, do certain types of chocolate bars tend to be more popular during the winter holiday season or in different parts of the world?
- Are there any ingredients or flavor combinations that tend to be associated with high or low chocolate bar ratings? For example, do bars with sea salt or caramel tend to receive higher ratings than bars with more traditional flavors?
- Can you identify any outliers or unexpected results in your database, and what might be causing them?

## Analysis 

## Results 
"Latin American beans tend to be complex. Some might be bright and fruity, with notes of dried apricots, fresh berries and dark fruit, while others taste of nuts or fresh herbs. West African chocolates are often more straightforwardly fudgy, sometimes tinged with flavors of coconut, raisins and coffee" - NY TImes
